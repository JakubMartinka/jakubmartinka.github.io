They dictate how molecules jump between electronic states during light-driven processes-key for understanding everything from vision to solar energy conversion. Traditionally, simulating these transitions requires Tully’s fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH), a powerful but computationally intensive method. Running FSSH trajectories demands hundreds of thousands of expensive quantum chemical calculations, severely limiting the size of molecules and the number of trajectories we can study. Machine learning (ML) promises to change this-but predicting NACs is far from straightforward. Unlike energies or forces, NACs are vectorial, double-valued, and can spike near conical intersections (CIs), where two electronic states cross. Additionally, the arbitrary phase of quantum wave functions can flip NAC vectors, introducing inconsistencies that derail ML training.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/rpr-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/rpr-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/rpr-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/rpr.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The procedure consists of three steps:</p> <ol> <li>Rotate each molecular geometry into a canonical orientation defined by its tensor of inertia.</li> <li>Predict the vector or tensor property in that orientation using any machine learning model trained on data in the canonical orientation.</li> <li>Rotate the predicted properties back to the original molecular orientation.</li> </ol> <p>To test the method, we studied 1,2-dithioethane, a molecule whose dipole moment and polarizability vary with torsional motion. We trained a kernel ridge regression model using the relative-to-equilibrium descriptor, based on DFT/B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations, and sampled the configurational space by running ground-state molecular dynamics. The selected points for the test set are shown in black:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/dihedral-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/dihedral-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/dihedral-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/dihedral.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The machine learning models produced accurate, rotationally covariant predictions of both properties across molecular dynamics trajectory frames. This was also achieved thanks to task-specific descriptor design. Because the approach relies only on elementary linear algebra, training is fast, prediction is inexpensive, and the models remain accurate, as shown in the scatter plots of dipole moment and polarizability components:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/dipole-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/dipole-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/dipole-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/dipole.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/pol-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/pol-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/pol-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/pol.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Scatterplots showing the DFT dipole moment (left) and polarizability components (right) of the test set consisting of 1200 points with respect to ML predictions of the models trained on 1000 points.
