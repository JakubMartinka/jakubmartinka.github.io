A key part of these simulations involves modeling how molecules transition between excited states—often through conical intersections—using methods like Tully’s fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH).</p> <p>FSSH is a popular approach, but it’s computationally demanding. Running accurate simulations typically requires hundreds of thousands of quantum chemistry calculations, limiting the size of systems and timescales that can be studied.</p> <p>Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution. By training models to predict critical quantities like energies, gradients, and couplings, ML can bypass the need for costly calculations. While ML has already sped up predictions of energies and gradients, accurately modeling nonadiabatic couplings (NACs)—which are essential for determining hopping events in FSSH—remains a challenge. NACs are sensitive, vectorial quantities that behave unpredictably near avoided crossings.</p> <p>Our work introduces a new ML framework that combines gradient-difference descriptors and phase correction to deliver highly accurate NAC predictions. This enables fast, fully ML-driven FSSH simulations, as we demonstrate on the classic photochemical system fulvene.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/chart-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/chart-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/chart-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/chart.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Caption photos easily.
