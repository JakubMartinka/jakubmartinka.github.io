Hi, I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Faculty of Science](https://www.natur.cuni.cz/eng) of [Charles University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_University) in Prague, working at the [Department of Theoretical chemistry](https://www.jh-inst.cas.cz/department/department-of-theoretical-chemistry#department) at the Institute of Physical Chemistry [J. Heyrovský](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Heyrovsk%C3%BD), [Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.avcr.cz/en/) in [Jiří Pittner's group](https://www.jh-inst.cas.cz/~pittner/). I try to share my interest in science during my private teaching of natural sciences, which I started already in high school. Talking about science is amazing and that is why I would also like to devote myself to popularizing science in the future, if you are interested in a popularization-style presentation about the work within our group (machine learning and quantum chemistry) please do not hesitate to contact me!

I come from the eastern part of the Czech Republic, [Moravia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravia), the land of wine and slivovice. I grew up in [Zlín](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zl%C3%ADn) (and studied here at the [Gymnasium Zlín - Lesní čtvrť](https://www.gymzl.cz/en/)). The [Baťa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bata_Corporation) brand was founded in this city and thanks to this the city has its functionalist character, among other things there is also a [sculpture](https://www.google.com/search?q=velk%C3%BD+fibonacci&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsZIh4h6ZRc-rxthav5tN6aC8Z3LgA:1669505332124&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8g5aCgM37AhVcSPEDHcnbAFEQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=948&bih=895&dpr=1) expressing the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). I am an amateur chess player and as part of that I have also helped out at some chess events and even acted as a referee. I like to travel and have meaningless conversations with interesting people I meet.
