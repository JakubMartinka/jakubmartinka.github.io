Hi, I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Faculty of Science](https://www.natur.cuni.cz/eng) of [Charles University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_University) in Prague, working at the [Department of Theoretical chemistry](https://www.jh-inst.cas.cz/department/department-of-theoretical-chemistry#department) at the Institute of Physical Chemistry [J. Heyrovský](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Heyrovsk%C3%BD), [Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.avcr.cz/en/) in [Jiří Pittner's group](https://www.jh-inst.cas.cz/~pittner/). I try to share my interest in science during my private teaching of natural sciences, which I started already in high school. Talking about science is amazing and that is why I would also like to devote myself to popularizing science in the future, if you are interested in a popularization-style presentation about the work within our group (machine learning and quantum chemistry) please do not hesitate to contact me!
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
