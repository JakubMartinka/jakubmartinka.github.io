Hi, I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Faculty of Science](https://natur.cuni.cz/en) at [Charles University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_University) in Prague. I work in the [Department of Theoretical chemistry](https://www.jh-inst.cas.cz/department/department-of-theoretical-chemistry#department), part of the [J. Heyrovský](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Heyrovsk%C3%BD) Institute of Physical Chemistry, [Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.avcr.cz/en/) (CAS), as a member of [Jiří Pittner's group](https://www.jh-inst.cas.cz/~pittner/). I’m passionate about sharing my love for science and have been teaching natural sciences since high school. 

Our group focus on *Ultrafast dynamics of molecules and clusters including non-adiabatic and spin-orbit effects* and particularly on how to use machine learning to accelerate such a simulations. We contribute to the [Newton-X](https://newtonx.org/) and [MLatom](http://mlatom.com/) packages. Other topics of our group includes *Quantum chemical methods for strongly correlated systems, in particular Multireference and DMRG-based externally corrected coupled cluster methods* and *Quantum computer algorithms for quantum chemistry*.
If you would like to learn more about our group’s research  or about my projects, feel free to reach out!

Teaching and communicating science is incredibly fulfilling to me, and I hope to continue in the future.
I am participating in a Czech science popularization project called [Zeptej se vědce](https://zeptejsevedce.cz/) ("Ask a Scientist"), where scientists answer (sometimes ridiculous) questions, as well as the CAS project [Otevřená Věda](https://www.otevrenaveda.cz/cs/index.html) ("Open Science") for motivated high school students. I come from the eastern part of the Czech Republic, [Moravia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravia), the land of wine and [slivovice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz). I grew up in [Zlín](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zl%C3%ADn), where I studied at the [Gymnasium Zlín - Lesní čtvrť](https://www.gymzl.cz/en/)). Zlín is notable for its [Baťa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bata_Corporation) heritage, and the city's functionalist character. One of my favourite nerdy landmarks is a [sculpture](https://www.google.com/search?q=velk%C3%BD+fibonacci&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsZIh4h6ZRc-rxthav5tN6aC8Z3LgA:1669505332124&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8g5aCgM37AhVcSPEDHcnbAFEQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=948&bih=895&dpr=1) based on the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). I am an amateur [chess](https://lichess.org/@/JakeFox) player and I've had the opportunity to assist at few chess events, sometimes as a referee. I also love traveling and striking up interesting conversations with people I meet along the way.

I wrote these pages as an experiment because I enjoy reading about other people. If you want to talk with me about something else than science, you can try philosophy of science, travelling, chess, rock climbing or football.
